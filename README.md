# Voxel-SVIO

**Voxel-SVIO** (Voxel-SVIO: Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry based on Voxel Map) is a MSCKF based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) that utilizes voxel-based map management. The voxel-based map management enables VIO systems to efficiently retrieve the most suitable points for optimizer inclusion, thereby ensuring optimal allocation of computational resources to the variables most critical for optimization.
